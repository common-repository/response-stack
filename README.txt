Response stack engages with your community by bringing audience comments into your posts.

== Description ==

Response Stack uses WordPress shortcodes to pull comments (and comment threads) into a post from other posts on the same site. Authors can use threaded comments and even pull comments from multiple other stories, based on the comment ID. To get the shortcode working type the following into its own line in your post:

`[responser comment="id" thread="depth"]` where `id` is equal to the integer ID of the comment and `depth` is equal to the integer depth of the thread of comments you want visible. 

Readers looking at the comments can even respond to them within the shortcode's post, submitting threaded replies that will then take them to the original conversation. 

You can find the comment id by looking at the hyperlink attached to any comment datetime stamp (on the post or in the comments page of the dashboard), where it will be in the format of `http://site/post-link/#comment-CommentIDNumber`.

Response Stack assumes you are using default WordPress comments. Support for other commenting systems is to come. If you'd like to add support for your commenting system, contribute to the project [GitHub](https://github.com/CFOPublishing/response-stack/)
